        <p id="HIB">
          Body mass index (BMI) is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the
          square of height in meters. BMI is an inexpensive and easy screening
          method for weight category—underweight, healthy weight, overweight,
          and obesity. BMI does not measure body fat directly, but BMI is
          moderately correlated with more direct measures of body fat
          Furthermore, BMI appears to be as strongly correlated with various
          metabolic and disease outcome as are these more direct measures of
          body fatness
        </p>
        <h3 id="T2">How is BMI used?</h3>
        <p id="HIBU">
          BMI can be a screening tool, but it does not diagnose the body fatness
          or health of an individual. To determine if BMI is a health risk, a
          healthcare provider performs further assessments. Such assessments
          include skin fold thickness measurements, evaluations of diet,
          physical activity, and family history
